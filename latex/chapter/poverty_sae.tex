\section{Poverty indicators and small area estimation}

After the introduction to the basics of Bayesian inference and model evaluation, this section describes how hierarchical Bayesian models are used in small area estimation â€“ with a special focus on unit-level models.
It then defines the poverty indicators that are at the center of this paper and presents an algorithm to estimate those indicators with hierarchical Bayesian models.
