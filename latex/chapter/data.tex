\chapter{Income Data and its Challenges}

Before discussing Bayesian workflow in detail, it is necessary to analyze the problem at the core of the present paper: how to adequately model income data, which is the basis for estimating poverty indicators.
The first section presents reasons why modelling income data is challenging.
It also briefly discusses available modelling possibilities and their drawbacks.
In the second section, the data set from the Mexican state of Guerrero used throughout this paper is introduced together with the relevant variables.
The survey design of the Mexican data is summarized in the third section, which is useful for certain modelling decisions, as will become clear in section \ref{ch:raneff}.
The last section formulates simulation scenarios that capture the main difficulties of income data, based on the scenarios in \cite{rojas_perilla_data_2020}.
The simulations have the advantage that the true data generating process is known are used to check the results from different models without having to use the data multiple times.
