\section{Overview of Bayesian statistics}

This section provides a short introduction to the main concepts of Bayesian statistics.
An exhaustive exposition of Bayesian statistics can be found in sources such as \cite{gelman_bayesian_2014} or \cite{mcelreath_statistical_2020}.
The first part presents the notation of Bayes' theorem and introduces the components of a Bayesian model, while the second part summarizes different ways of evaluating Bayesian models that will be used throughout this paper to compare multiple models.
The more technical topic of Bayesian computation is introduced in appendix \ref{ch:computation} â€“ specifically, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms.
In general, the reader should assume that there were no major computational problems in the models presented, unless otherwise specified.
