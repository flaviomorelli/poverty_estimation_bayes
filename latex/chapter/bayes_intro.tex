\section{Overview of Bayesian statistics}

This section provides a short introduction to the main concepts of Bayesian statistics.
The aim is both to provide a refresher for the reader and to introduce the notation used in the rest of this paper.
However, it is not an exhaustive summary of all concepts related to Bayesian statistics, which can be found in more detail in sources such as BDA3.
The first section presents the notation of Bayes' theorem and introduces the components of a Bayesian model.
The second section summarizes different ways of evaluating Bayesian models that will be used throughout this paper to compare multiple models.
The more technical topic of Bayesian computation is introduced in appendix XY.
In general terms, the reader should assume that there were no major computational problems in the models presented unless otherwise specified.
