\section{Initial models}
\label{ch:initial}
This section compares two different categories of initial models, which corresponds to the first step of the workflow in \cite{gelman_bayesian_2020}.
The first one is an extension of model \ref{eq:mod_hb} from \cite{morelli_hierarchical_2021} that does full Bayesian inference on the shift parameter of the log-shift transform.
The second category includes a series of skewed likelihoods, which are tested against the simulation scenarios from section \ref{ch:simulations} through posterior predictive tests.
At the end of this section, there is a short discussion on the adequacy of each type model when dealing with unimodal, skewed, leptokurtic data.
