\chapter{Theoretical Background}
The present chapter is an overview of the key theoretical concepts used in the rest of this paper.
The main aim is to provide a short theoretical review to the reader, but not to discuss every theoretical aspect in detail.
Additional literature references are mentioned when necessary.
Note that more specific theoretical ideas will be introduced in the relevant step of the workflow in chapter \ref{ch:workflow}.
Because this paper develops a model iteratively, this structure should make it easier to understand the incremental changes to the model, instead of presenting all theory at once in one chapter.

The first section provides a short summary of Bayesian statistics, starting with Bayes' theorem and then discussing Bayesian model evaluation.
The second half of this chapter presents Bayesian unit-models used for small area estimation.
It defines the poverty indicators and shows how to estimate them in a Bayesian context.
