\chapter{Appendix: Density Plots from the Full Horseshoe Model}
\label{appendix:horseshoe_plot}

Figure \ref{fig:hs_dens} shows the density plots for the full horseshoe model with the variables from section \ref{ch:mexican_data}.
There are two types of variable that can be considered irrelevant to the model.
On the one hand, variables such as \code{jexp} (work experience of head of household) with very small coefficients.
On the other hand, the effect of variables such as \code{jsexo} (gender of head of household) is not clearly positive or negative.
Section \ref{ch:varsel} describes how the horseshoe prior is used to choose the relevant predictors.
