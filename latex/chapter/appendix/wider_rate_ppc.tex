\chapter{Appendix: Prior predictive checks for wider scale prior}
\label{appendix:wide_prior}

Figure \ref{fig:ppc_wide} presents the prior predictive checks for a prior $Ga(2, 0.01)$ on the scale parameters $\sigma$ and $\sigma_u$.
The samples from the prior predictive distribution have a very extreme for the logarithmic scale, even when compared to Figure \ref{fig:ppc_start}.
Note that there is an unnatural accumulation of observations at the extremes of the x-axis of almost all scatterplots.
This indicates very extreme samples from $p(y)$ that had take the values $\pm \infty$.
In this case, the prior on the scale parameters is too wide to produce realistic values.
