\chapter{Results}

This chapter presents the results of the model developed in the workflow.
First, the FGT estimates for the final SAR model are presented and compared with the estimators from the Box-Cox EBP.
Then, the RMSE of the Bayesian is estimated and compared with the EBP model.
As there is no RMSE estimator for the HB model without flat priors, this comparison is done with the simulation scenarios from section \ref{ch:simulations}.
In the first two sections, it is clear that the HB produces results comparable with the EBP.
Finally, the multiple models developed throughout are compared used the weights from model stacking.
