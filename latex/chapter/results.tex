\chapter{Comparing EBP and HB models}

This chapter presents the results of the model developed in the workflow.
First, the FGT estimates for the final SAR model are presented and compared with the estimators from the Box-Cox EBP.
In the second section, the RMSE of the Bayesian is estimated and compared with the EBP model.
As there is no RMSE estimator available for the HB model without flat priors, this comparison is done with the simulation scenarios from section \ref{ch:simulations}.
In this first two sections, the HB produces results comparable estimates with the EBP with differences in uncertainty quantification..
Finally, the various Bayesian models developed throughout this paper are compared using the weights from model stacking.
